<h1>Magento Product Redirect</h1>
<p>
	This module saves some important attributes before a product is deleted.
	When this product's url is called the next time, instead of a 404-Error
	a page is being displayed telling the customer that the product is no longer
	available and redirecting him to other, similar, products.
